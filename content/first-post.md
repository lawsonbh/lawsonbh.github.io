# First of Many Posts

I am incredibly excited to start posting on my new personal blog. Right now, top of mind for me are long term titles for this little corner of the internet. Current front runners are:
- Bernies Blog
- Awesome Blog
- Data Doots
- Bernies Backyard Bees

I will hold off on any binding decisions for the moment. 

Moving forward, I will mostly use this space to reflect on things I am learning with technology. I hope readers are also ready for the occasional post about my garden, Star Wars, and the wider world.
