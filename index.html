<p>As part of reflecting on work I've done, I wanted to start by sharing how I approach Spark Optimizations.</p>
<p>I have a love-hate relationship with Spark. You can process incredible amounts of data with it. You can also find yourself looking at hanging tasks, crazy compute costs, and silly storage situations. </p>
<p>When someone called me in to help with a workload in Spark, I tried to really hone in on the following before starting any hands on coding work:</p>
<ol>
<li>What's the objective?</li>
<li>What's the current baseline performance?</li>
<li>How do we know that any changes we introduce will still produce appropriate output? IE Do we know what correct-enough looks like?</li>
</ol>
<p>The majority of the situations I was brought in to help with were focused on meeting some kind of time based deadline IE we need to speed this workload up!</p>
<p>Symptoms I looked at:</p>
<ul>
<li>What jobs are taking the longest?</li>
<li>Within those jobs, do the stages make sense? </li>
<li>Within a stage, how well distributed are the tasks?</li>
</ul>
<p>I solved the vast majority of issues just within the Spark UI. It's pretty great and I could do a whole post about it if there's interest!</p>
<p>All of this needs to be in the context of that objective you set up front with the work plan. </p>
<p>A good portion of the workloads I've encountered can be addressed by taking a look at how often shuffles are occurring and how often executors are staying idle. 
If you are interested in a deep dive into any of these topics let me know!</p>                </article>

<ul>
<li>Bernies Blog</li>
<li>Awesome Blog</li>
<li>Data Doots</li>
<li>Bernies Backyard Bees</li>
</ul>
